#Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based forest fire detection system using image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNN). In Week 2, we focus on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and configuring our CNN model.

Week 2 Milestones

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Loading and understanding the dataset.
Visualizing key features to identify patterns.
Handling missing values, if any.
Normalization and preprocessing techniques.

2. Building CNN Configurations
Choosing an appropriate CNN architecture.
Defining layers (Convolution, Pooling, Fully Connected).
Setting up hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs).
Implementing data augmentation techniques.
